How is the weather values taken into account in the simulator?

1. There is a weight associated to the weather (weight.3)
2. A weather values is computed using the following logic:
    For RMS:
        - the value (X) from the data file is gotten.
        - then given the frequency, elevation and baseline values we get a 
          value (Y1) using the following formula:
          Y1 = X * ( freq/11.2) * (sin(36 * PI/180) / sin(elevation)) * baseline^(1/3)
    For Wind Speed:
        - the actual value (Y2) in the data file is used.
    For Opacity:
        - the actual value (Y3) from the data file is used.

    If in the future additional weather parameters were gotten they would be obtained
    at this point.
    
3. The product of these values (Yi) is obtained and used to calculate a success factor
   for the particular SB, given its elevation position (with its weight(weight.1)) and
   its maximum elevation position (with its weight(weight.2)). The SUCCESS calculation
   currently is:
    
    S = [ (elevation_position * weight.1) + (max_elevation_position * weight.2 )
            + (weather * weight.3) ] / (weight.1 + weight.2 + weight.3)
4. Each of the weights are determined by what the user has put into the scheduling 
   policy.

How is baseband determined?   
    Given all the antennas defined in the input file (which is antenna locations in 
    chile for the compact configuration of 50 antennas) the distance between each 
    antenna is calculated and the maximum baseline is used.

How is frequency determined?
    Each SB is assigned a frequency which is used directly. 

Weights for factors used in calculation of best SB found where?
    They are found in the input file, prefixed with Weight.

How is priority taken into account?
    Priority is user/commity defined in the project files. It is also given a weight.
    So when the score of a SB is being computed, there is a RANK caluclation which 
    consists of 
        rank = priority.weight * priority

What is the final scoring of a SB?
    Once the success of a SB is calculated and it is ranked then those two values are
    multiplied to give the SB a score.
