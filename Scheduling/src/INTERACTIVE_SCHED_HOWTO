How to start/use the ALMA Interactive Scheduling GUI (this is also on the ALMA SCHEDULING Twiki)

Getting the GUI up:
   * Start the ARCHIVE and load all the ALMA Schemas into the archive (you must have all ALMA Subsystems installed also).
   * Start up ACS-4.1.3 
   * Put an ObsProject/ObsProgram/SchedBlock project into the archive. 
      * There is a default project known to work with the scheduling system in SCHEDULING/Scheduling/test called Project.zip that works with 'ALMA-OT -batch'
   * Start up and initialize all the ALMA Systems using their master components.
   * Bring up Object Explorer (objexp) and click on the Master Scheduling component.
   * Click the startInteractiveScheduling method and a GUI should pop up (might take a few seconds, if you get the 5000 timeout warning, just ignore it!)
  
  
Using the GUI:
   * First you need to login. The username will be the PI defined in the ObsProject. In the default project (Project.zip) in scheduling's test dir it will be ALMA_PI
   * Once you log in you will see a project loaded with its details in the first tab and the scheduling block details in the second tab.
   * If there were more than one project sent to the interactive scheduler, you can access those via the Projects menu 

   Adding or Updating a SB Button: 
      * With the project you want loaded into the interactive gui, click on this button in the SB View area. This will spawn the ObservingTool with the sb's project. Add another scheduling block to the project or modifiy something in an existing SB, using the Observing Tool. Once you have made your changes you will need to save it (using the OT) and then back in the interactive scheduling gui you will need to update your view using the Update SB button in the SB View area.

   Update SB View Button:
      * Once you have added or modified a sb using the observing tool and done a save (to update it in the archive) click the Update SB View button and your modifications should show up in the SB list.

   Delete an SB Button:
      * NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
      * Doesn't do anything right now.


   Execute an SB Button:
      * First you must select an sb from the list, then click the execute sb button.
      * This will send the SB to the control system (which must be initialzied!) and it will be executed.

   Stop Current SB Button:
      * NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
      * You will only be able to stop an sb if it is started executing. 
   
   
If all else fails.. come find sohaila...
