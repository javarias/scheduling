# Project data with sets and target lists

# Project data is entered in the form of data identifying the project
# followed by a list of sets that belong to that project.  Following each
# set is a series of target entries.  An ObsUnitSet is created for each set 
# entry and a scheduling block, belonging to that set, is created for each 
# target entry.
#
# Syntax:
#
#     numberProjects = N
#     project.<i> = projectName; PI; priority; numberSets 
#	  set.<i>.<j> = setName; frequency-band; frequency; weather-condition; numberTargets
#     target.<i>.<j>.<k> = targetName; ra; dec; frequency; total-time; weather-condition; repeat-count; lstBegin; lstEnd
#
# where 0 <= i < N and 
# 		0 <= j < numberSets[i] and 
#		0 <= k < numberTargets[i][j].
# Units: ra hours, dec degrees, frequency GHz, total-time minutes.
# 
# All sets must specify the same frequency band.  A default frequency and 
# weather-condition must be specified for the set but these may be overridden
# on the target.  There are no optional parameters on the set statement.
# 
# There are a number of optional parameters on a target statement, however.
# a. The "repeat-count" is optional and may be omitted (in which case it is 0).
# b. The LST range is optional; however if lstBegin is specified, then repeat-count
#    and lstEnd must be specified.  The purpose of the LST range is to request
#    support of expanded U-V coverage. 
# c. The "frequency" and "weather-condition" on a target are optional and if
#    not specified are inherited from the set.
# 
# The priority is: highest, higher, high, mediumPlus, medium, mediumMinus, low, lower, lowest, background
# 
# The weather-condition is: exceptional, excellent, good, average, belowaverage, poor, dismal, any

numberProjects = 2
# two projects, different frequencys and opacity expectations of 0.17 at
