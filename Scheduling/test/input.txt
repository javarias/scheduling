# The dynamic scheduling algorithm

# For the R1 simulation, there is one dynamic scheduling algorithm.
# For it, one can specify the weights on the various factors computed
# in the algorithm.  The definitions of the factors are given below.
#
# positionElevation
#     sin of the current elevation or 0.0 if the source is not visible, 
#         max = 1.0 min = 0.0
# positionMaximum
#     Returns 1.0 if the current LST is close to the LST at the maximum
#     elevation of the source and diminishes as it is further away.   
#         max = 1.0 min = 0.0
# weather
#     weather expression evaluation, max = 1.0 min = 0.0
# priority
#     the scientific priority, value: 10(high)/9/8/7/6/5/4/3/2/1
# sameProjectSameBand
#     SB belongs to same project and frequency band as current, value: 1/0
# sameProjectDifferentBand
#     SB belongs to same project as current but has a different frequency band, 
#         value: 1/0
# differentProjectSameBand
#     SB belongs to a different project but has same frequency band as current, 
#         value: 1/0
# differentProjectDifferentBand
#     SB belongs to a different project and has different frequency band from 
#         current, value: 1/0
# newProject
#     the cost of starting a new project, value: 1/0
# oneSBRemaining
#     only one SB remains in the project, value: 1/0
# The success calculation is:
#     positionWeight * positionFactor + weatherWeight * weatherFactor
# The ranking calculation is:
#     priorityWeight * priorityFactor + 
#     sameProjectSameBandWeight * sameProjectSameBandFactor +
#     sameProjectDifferentBandWeight * sameProjectDifferentBandFactor +
#     differentProjectSameBandWeight * differentProjectSameBandFactor +
#     differentProjectDifferentBandWeight * differentProjectDifferentBandFactor +
#     newProjectWeight * newProjectFactor +
#     oneSBRemainingWeight * oneSBRemainingFactor
# The final score is:
#     success * ranking
