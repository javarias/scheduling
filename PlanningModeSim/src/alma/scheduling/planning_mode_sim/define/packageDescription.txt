Within the Scheduling Subsystem, the Define package contains utility classes 
of a general nature that are used in the other packages that make up the 
scheduling subsystem.  In addition, it contains the definition of an observing 
project and its hierarchically structured components, observing unit sets, and 
scheduling blocks from the Scheduling Subsystem’s perspective.  These latter 
definitions may be viewed as “wrapper” classes on the ObsProject, ObsUnitSet, 
and SchedBlock XML entities as defined in the Observing Preparation Subsystem.  
However, they serve as abstractions, defined from a scheduling perspective.
