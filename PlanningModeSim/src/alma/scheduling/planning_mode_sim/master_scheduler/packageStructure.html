<p>
<strong>
public class  <font color=red> ALMAArchive </font> 
</strong>
<p>
The ArchiveProxy class is the interface to the real or simulated archive.
<p>

<strong>
public class  <font color=red> ALMAClock </font> extends ClockBase 
</strong>
<p>
The Clock class gives access to the array time, as implemented by the Control System, in the real mode.  In the simulation mode, this class accesses the ClockSimulator in the simulation class.
<p>

<strong>
public class  <font color=red> ALMADispatcher </font> implements ControlProxy 
</strong>
<p>
The Dispatcher class presents a list of scheduling blocks for execution to the telescope operator, in priority order, and waits for a selection. If no selection is made, then the first one is selected.  It then  initiates the execution of the selected scheduling block.
<p>

<strong>
public class  <font color=red> ALMATelescopeOperator </font> implements Scheduling_to_TelescopeOperator 
</strong>
<p>
Description 
<p>

<strong>
public interface  <font color=red> ArchiveProxy </font> 
</strong>
<p>
Description 
<p>

<strong>
public interface  <font color=red> ControlProxy </font> 
</strong>
<p>
The ControlProxy interface specifies those methods needed by Scheduling from the Control system.  The methods are implemented by the ALMADispatcher and by the ControlSimulator. 
<p>

<strong>
public class  <font color=red> MasterSBQueue </font> 
</strong>
<p>
The MasterSBQueue class is the collection of scheduling blocks currently under consideration by the scheduling system.
<p>

<strong>
class  <font color=red> SchedBlock </font> 
</strong>

<p>

<strong>
public class  <font color=red> MasterSchedulerAction </font> implements Runnable 
</strong>
<p>
The MasterSchedulerAction class encapsulates periodic actions that must be executed by the MasterScheduler.  these include, getting new  scheduling blocks and project definitions from the archive, analyzing the master queue for fixed events and possible changes in sub-array  configuratiions.
<p>

<strong>
public class  <font color=red> SchedulingException </font> extends Exception 
</strong>
<p>
Description 
<p>

<strong>
public interface  <font color=red> Scheduling_to_TelescopeOperator </font> 
</strong>
<p>
This interface is implemented in the TelescopeOperator class using interfaces in the Executive subsystem. (See ICD sectio 3.4)  This  interface is used by the MasterScheduler and Schedulers to send  information to the telescope operator. In some cases replies are  expected.
<p>

<strong>
public class  <font color=red> TaskControlInfo </font> 
</strong>
<p>
TaskControlInfo is an informational object that is used by the MasterScheduler to monitor and control a subordinate component that is a thread.  Such an object is shared between the MasterScheduler and the subordinate thread.
