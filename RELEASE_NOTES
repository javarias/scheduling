Important Comments:
    For MONTHLY-2005-09:
    - Due to the complexity of the control system this version of scheduling has not been fully tested. It has been tested with the version of control (plus a couple of bug fixes which hopefully made it into this month's release) from -08.

Configuration Requirements:
    - ACS-4.1.3
    - MicroArchive that was released with ACS
    - All other subsystems that are installed before scheduling in the build 
      process must be installed.
    - A full ALMA-CDB  must be present.
    
Scheduling's CDB requirements:
    * Components.xml
      <_ Name="SCHEDULING_MASTER_COMP"
            Code="alma.scheduling.AlmaScheduling.SchedulingMasterComponentHelper"
            Type="IDL:alma/ACS/MasterComponent:1.0"
            Container="java"/>

      <_ Name="SCHEDULING_MASTERSCHEDULER"
            Code="alma.scheduling.AlmaScheduling.MasterSchedulerIFHelper"
            Type="IDL:alma/scheduling/MasterSchedulerIF:1.0"
            Container="java" 
            Default="true" />

    * Plus an instance of the master component in the alma dir

Tested:
    - JUnit tests have been written for some of the classes. Alot of the 
      functionality cannot be tested as it is now without extreme interaction 
      with other ALMA subsystems. In the future scheduling simulators will be
      completed to avoid this interaction in testing.
  			  
    - Scheduling has been tested using entities created using the ALMA-OT batchmode.
      There is a Project.zip file in the src directory which has been modified to 
      contain a source which is *always* visible from the ATF location.


Tests: 
    - All the tests below run as a suite, AllTests.java
        AllTests include:
            TestAntenna
            TestDateTime
            TestStatus
            TestTime
    - There is a test simTest which tests the Planning Mode Simulator.
    - There is a test called pubTest which tests the NC Publisher for scheduling

TEST NOTE: Scheduling now has an Interactive Scheduling Mode. This requires human interaction
           and therefore cannot be automatically tested. For more imformation on how to test 
           the Interactive Scheduling mode please read the INTERACTIVE_SCHED_HOWTO in the src
           directory.
    
Known problems/bugs:

    - There was a problem in the time that CONTROL sent via the ExecBlockStarted event. 
      It should be fixed in cvs but just incase there are problems thats one thing that 
      could be the cause.

    - In interactive scheduling when the observing tool is used (when sb is 
      added or updated..) problems occur with the acs container. This due to 
      the way the OT shuts down or something.. 
      
Changes:
    - There is a new schema SpecialSB. Which is an example of one type of a fixed scheduling
      block. With one of these stored in the archive, startScheduling will create a 
      scheduler for it. There is a script (storeSpecialSB) to put one in the archive.

    - If a SB has a repeat count, the scheduler now schedules the sb that many times. In
      the given Project.zip there is a repeat count of 5 so you should see 5 executions.
      The ProjectStatus.xml should have 5 sessions and 5 exec blocks.
    
    - New way of dealing/sending out session events. 
    
    - Scheduling of an ordered queue is implemented. Tho its really just scheduling of a list of SBs 

    - Interactive scheduling has a new look. same functionality tho. There's a HOWTO availble in src and on the scheduling twiki web.

    - Scheduling now receives (but doesn't do anything with) the TELCAL events. A log message is just sent out.
    

    Old:
    - Alot of fixes to the project status structure manipulation was done.
    - New functionality to talk to the Operator component from exec. To send a message that the a session has started and stopped.
    - Name changes for channel names and CDB stuff required by ITS
    - Now sending pipeline the PPR xml string in ProcessRequest
   	- PlanningModeSim and RealMode modules have been merged into one, Scheduling. 
    - Updated CDB
    

   New Structure
   
     - Scheduling now has one module. SCHEDULING/Scheduling
    
     
   New Features:
   
     - SchedulingMasterComponent exists, not sure if its implemented the way EXEC requires. 
     - Interactive Scheduling is up and running in a very elementary way.
     - ProjectStatus is now used
     - New entity, Session, has been implemented 
     - New Events, start session and end session, have been implemented.
        
     
   Fixed Problems:

     - ExecBlockEvent problem found in R1.1 integration has been corrected for
       future integrations

     - Problem with the StartSesion and EndSession events. Parameter was null, which corba 
       didn't like but didnt complain about.
