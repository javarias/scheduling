Configuration Requirements:
    - ACS-4.0.2
    - MicroArchive that was released with ACS
    - All other subsystems that are installed before scheduling in the build 
      process must be installed.
    - A full ALMA-CDB  must be present.Especially needed are 
  			OBSPREP
  			CORR
  			CONTROL
  			PIPELINE
  			TELCAL
  			and of course SCHEDULING
    
Scheduling's CDB requirements:
    * Components.xml
      <_ Name="SCHEDULING_MASTER_COMP"
            Code="alma.scheduling.AlmaScheduling.SchedulingMasterComponentHelper"
            Type="IDL:alma/ACS/MasterComponent:1.0"
            Container="java"/>

      <_ Name="SCHEDULING_MASTERSCHEDULER"
            Code="alma.scheduling.AlmaScheduling.MasterSchedulerIFHelper"
            Type="IDL:alma/scheduling/MasterSchedulerIF:1.0"
            Container="java" 
            Default="true" />

    * Plus an instance of the master component in the alma dir

Tested:
    - JUnit tests have been written for some of the classes. Alot of the 
      functionality cannot be tested as it is now without extreme interaction 
      with other ALMA subsystems. In the future scheduling simulators will be
      completed to avoid this interaction in testing.
  			  
    - Scheduling has been tested using entities created using the ALMA-OT batchmode. The files
      used duiring this process are present in the test directory. 

Requirements for Scheduling Tests for R2:
    - All the ALMA Subsystems must already be installed. Especially Control and Pipeline because 
      their components are actually connected to in one of the scheduling tests.
    - The following steps must be preformed before running tat/make test on scheduling.
        - archiveCleanXindice
        - archiveLoadSchema $ACSROOT/idl
            (NOTE: I do not know where ITS puts all the schemas but
             all the schemas must be loaded correctly.)
        - ACS Started so that the ALMA-OT can be run using the command in the next step.
        - from the Scheduling's test directory:
            ALMA-OT -batch import-save.py ExpertTestProject.zip
            (NOTE: The ITS setup (ObservingTool.properties) might be different than the  
             file provided by scheduling. Depends on them)
        - Shutdown ACS 
        

Tests: 
    - All the tests below run as a suite, AllTests.java
        AllTests include:
            TestAntenna
            TestDateTime
            TestALMAControl
            TestStatus
            TestTime

TEST NOTE: Scheduling now has an Interactive Scheduling Mode. This requires human interaction
           and therefore cannot be automatically tested. For more imformation on how to test 
           the Interactive Scheduling mode please see Allen Farris or Sohaila Lucero.
    
Known problems/bugs:
    - In interactive scheduling when the observing tool is used (when sb is 
      added or updated..) problems occur with the acs container. This due to 
      the way the OT shuts down or something.. killACS seems to be the only way
      to restart without errors. Problem is still under investigation.
      
Cost:


Changes:
    - Name changes for channel names and CDB stuff required by ITS
    - Now sending pipeline the PPR xml string in ProcessRequest

    Old:
   	- PlanningModeSim and RealMode modules have been merged into one, Scheduling. 
    - Updated CDB
    

   New Structure
   
     - Scheduling now has one module. SCHEDULING/Scheduling
    
     
   New Features:
   
     - SchedulingMasterComponent exists, not sure if its implemented the way EXEC requires. 
     - Interactive Scheduling is up and running in a very elementary way.
     - ProjectStatus is now used
     - New entity, Session, has been implemented 
     - New Events, start session and end session, have been implemented.
        
     
   Fixed Problems:

     - ExecBlockEvent problem found in R1.1 integration has been corrected for
       future integrations

     - Problem with the StartSesion and EndSession events. Parameter was null, which corba didn't like but didnt complain about.
