Configuration Requirements:
    - ACS-3.1.2
    - MicroArchive that was released with ACS-3.1.2
    - All other subsystems that are installed before scheduling in the build 
      process must be installed.
    - A full ALMA-CDB  must be present.Especially needed are 
  			OBSPREP
  			CORR
  			CONTROL
  			PIPELINE
  			TELCAL
  			and of course SCHEDULING
    


Tested:
    - JUnit tests have been written for some of the classes. Alot of the 
      functionality cannot be tested as it is now without extreme interaction 
      with other ALMA subsystems. In the future scheduling simulators will be
      completed to avoid this interaction in testing.
  			  


Tests: all run as a suite, AllTests.java
    Tests include:
        TestAntenna
        TestDateTime
        TestALMAArchive
        TestALMAControl
        TestStatus
        TestTime
    
Known problems/bugs:
    - In interactive scheduling when the observing tool is used (when sb is 
      added or updated..) problems occur with the acs container. This due to 
      the way the OT shuts down or something.. killACS seems to be the only way
      to restart without errors. Problem is still under investigation.

Changes:
   Big Changes:
   	- PlanningModeSim and RealMode modules have been merged into one, Scheduling. 

   New Structure
   
     - Scheduling now has one module. SCHEDULING/Scheduling
    
     
   New Features:
   
     - Interactive Scheduling is up and running in a very elementary way.

     - New Events, start session and end session, have been implemented.
        
     
   Fixed Problems:
