<p>
The Scheduling Subsystem simulator operates in a number of distinct modes.

<ul>
<li> Full simulation
	<ul>
	<li>MasterScheduler, ProjectManager, and Schedulers are all running.
	<li>Full range of project manager actions are performed.
	<li>External responses are generated.
	<li>Full report of internal activities is generated.
	</ul>
<li> Planning mode
	<ul>
	<li>MasterScheduler and Schedulers in dynamic mode are running.
	<li>ProjectManager does not run.
	<li>No external responses are generated.
	<li>The order in which blocks are executed is reported.
	</ul>
<li> Fixed event mode 
	<ul>
	<li>This is a special purpose class that only engages in conflict
	    detection.  Only fixed events and blocks that must be scheduled 
	    at a particular time are dealt with.  Its purpose is to detect
	    any conflicts in scheduling these events.
	</ul>
</ul>

<p>
The requirements for the first phase of planning mode are as follows.
<ul>
	<li>The PipelineSimulator and CalibrationSimulator are null.
	<li>The ArchiveSimulator must be able to read scheduling blocks and
	    project definitions from many sources.
	<li>The ExcecutiveSimulator will start the MasterScheduler,
	    read all events and generate the reports that define the schedule.
	<li>The ControlSimulator functions in the normal manner.
</ul>
