Running the Plugin Interactive Test

Pre-load the archive with some projects:

	scripts/startup.sh
	scripts/populate.sh projects/R80*.aot
	scripts/shutdown.sh

From SCHEDULING/IntTest/test:

1) Start the system with

    ./scripts/testEnv start

2) Prepare the system to run the Plugins interactively

    ./scripts/runSchedulingPluginsTest <Mode>

where mode can be CreateArray, Interactive or Queued. If
no mode is specified, CreateArray is used.

3) Start the plugin. To start the CreateArray plugin use:

    ./scripts/startCreateArrayPlugin

and to start the Interactive or Queued plugin:

    ./scripts/startSchedulerPlugin

4) Interact with the plugins, load projects, execute them, etc.

5) To shutdown:

    ./scripts/testEnv stop
