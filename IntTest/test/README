Running the Plugin Interactive Test

The test must be installed in you INTROOT:
make all install

From SCHEDULING/IntTest/test:
1) Start the system with

    ./scripts/testEnv start

2) Pre-load the archive with some projects:

	If you are using for first time this test directory:
		archiveLoadSchema -c
		archiveLoadSchema $ACSROOT/idl
		archiveLoadSchema <Location of your ICD installation>/idl
		./scripts/initializeStateArchive

	./scripts/populate.sh projects/R80*.aot

2) Prepare the system to run the Plugins interactively

    ./scripts/runSchedulingPluginsTest <Mode>

where mode can be CreateArray, Interactive, Queued or Automated. If
no mode is specified, CreateArray is used.

3) Start the plugin. To start the CreateArray plugin use:

    ./scripts/startCreateArrayPlugin

to start the Interactive or Queued plugin:

    ./scripts/startSchedulerPlugin

4) Interact with the plugins, load projects, execute them, etc.

5) To shutdown:

    ./scripts/testEnv stop
